                <p>interalia operates the website accessible on the Internet at <a href="https://interalia.host/" target="_blank">https://interalia.host</a> and its respective subdirectories (hereinafter “interalia.host” or the “Website”).</p>
                <p>With this privacy policy, interalia would like to explain to you which data is processed in which form when you visit our website. This also fulfills our obligation to inform you in accordance with Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
                <p>I. Personal data, purposes and legal basis of data processing</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Personal data</li>
                </ol>
                <p>According to the GDPR, personal data means “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.”</p>

                </ol>
                <p><strong>Logfiles</strong></p>
                <p>We do not collect and store any personal data in the course of your visit to our website. Notwithstanding the above basic facts, however, the web server of our hoster automatically registers accesses to the websites and in particular your IP address. In addition, our hoster creates so-called log files to maintain system security. This information remains anonymous for us. It is therefore not possible to draw conclusions about a person. The log files contain the following information: IP-address, date of access, URL, contents accessed, transmitted information.</p>
                <p><strong>Newsletter</strong></p>
                <p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an email address from you as well as information from our verification that you are the owner the specified email address and agree to receive the newsletter (confirmation email). We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>

                <p>The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. The recipient of the data is Buttondown, LLC. The data stored by us as part of your consent for the purpose of the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from our servers as well as from the servers of Buttondown, LLC after you unsubscribe from the newsletter.</p>
                <p><strong>Contact</strong></p>
                <p>If you contact us at the email address provided on our website, you will at least provide us with your email address, as well as any other information you may disclose in your email. In order for us to process your request, we need to process this data. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. Our e-mail provider is Fastmail located in Australia.

                    <li>Purposes and legal basis of data processing</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The processing of your IP address during the connection setup takes place so that we can provide you with our website. It is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to provide our website.</p>
                <p>Processing in the context of contacting us takes place so that we can process and respond to your inquiry. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. By contacting us by email, you consent to the data processing.</p>
                <p>II. Recipients of the data</p>
                <p>Within our organization, the departments that are responsible for processing the requests have access to your data. In addition, we use external service providers if we cannot or cannot reasonably perform services ourselves. These external service providers are primarily providers of IT services and telecommunications services.</p>
                <p>III. Storage duration</p>
                <p>We store your emails and contacts for as long as it is necessary to process your inquiry and then store them for a period of 3 years in case you contact us again with reference to your original question. We archive business and commercial letters for ten years due to the German Tax Code. IV. Rights of data subjects</p>
                <p>The General Data Protection Regulation guarantees you certain rights that you can assert against us – insofar as the legal requirements are met.</p>
                <p><strong>Right to information</strong> (Art. 15 GDPR): You have the right to request confirmation from us as to whether personal data relating to you are being processed and, if so, what these are and the more detailed circumstances of the data processing.</p>
                <p><strong>Right to rectification</strong> (Art. 16 GDPR): You have the right to demand that we correct any inaccurate personal data relating to you without undue delay. In this context, you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data – also by means of a supplementary declaration – taking into account the purposes of the processing.</p>
                <p><strong>Right to erasure</strong> (Art. 17 GDPR): You have the right to demand that we delete personal data concerning you without delay. Please note here the exception described under IV.</p>
                <p><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong> (Art. 18 GDPR): You have the right to request that we restrict processing.</p>
                <p><strong>Right to data portability</strong> (Art. 20 GDPR): You have the right, in the event of processing based on consent or for the performance of a contract, to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to transfer this data to another controller without hindrance from us or to have the data transferred directly to the other controller, insofar as this is technically feasible.</p>
                <p><strong>Right to object</strong> (Art. 21 GDPR): You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is necessary for legitimate interests on our part or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or which is carried out in the exercise of official authority.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>If you object, we will no longer process your personal data in the future unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as we process your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object to the processing at any time. If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</strong> (Art. 77 GDPR in relation to § 19 Federal Data Protection Act): You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority at any time, in particular in the member state of your place of residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement, if you believe that the processing of personal data relating to you violates applicable law.</p>
